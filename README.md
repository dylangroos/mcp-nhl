# NHL API - Model Context Protocol

A TypeScript implementation of the NHL API using the Model-Context Protocol pattern. This MCP server provides access to NHL data including teams, players, standings, schedules, and statistics.

## Overview

This library provides a clean interface to the NHL's official APIs using the Model-Context Protocol (MCP). It allows you to fetch data from the NHL's APIs and provides it in a structured, easy-to-use format through MCP tools.

## üìä Current State

As of March 10, 2025, the platform provides the following functionality:

### ‚úÖ Working Features

   - Team statistics (skaters and goalies)
   - Prospect tracking

3. **Players**
   - Player biographical information
   - Current season and career statistics
   - Award recognition

4. **Schedules**
